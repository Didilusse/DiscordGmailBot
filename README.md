# Discord Email Bot


I started learning Java about a 2 days ago (11/2/21). I wanted to make a discord bot that would be useful and useable. So I decided to use Java Mail API and JDA to make this bot that tells you if you have any unread emails.

## Getting Started

  
  - I want to thank Stack Overflow for carrying this project
  - Download the project
  - [Enter your bot token in Bot.java](https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/)
  -  Enter your email and password in JavaMailSearchInbox.java
  - [Make sure to use an app password and not your actual password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en)

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 
- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
- [IDE (I used Eclipse)](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)


## Running the tests

To run the bot you need to go to Bot.java and run the script

## Deployment

As this is my second day learning java I have no idea how to run this program outside an IDE.

## Built With

  - [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) - Used
    for the Language
  - [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) - Used to make the 
  discord bot
